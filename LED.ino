const int ledPin = 13;
const int ledPin2 = 12;
const int buzzerPin = 7;

void setup() {
// Here we’ll set up pin 7 to receive the output that turns the LED on and off.
//We’ll use the pinMode() function to to this.  This function needs two values to operate.  
//The first value is the pin number, and the second value is either INPUT or OUTPUT. 

pinMode(ledPin,OUTPUT);
pinMode (ledPin2, OUTPUT);
pinMode (buzzerPin, OUTPUT);

//Note that each line of code we write must end in a ;

}

//We are done with our setup for this sketch so we can begin the  loop. 

void loop() {
// Here we will write code that does the following:
//Turns the LED on
//Leaves it on for a short period of time
//Turns the LED off
//Leaves it off for a short period of time before beginning the loop again. 

//To turn an LED on, we must make that output HIGH.  Setting it to LOW will turn it off. 

//digitalWrite() s the function we use to change an output in.  It takes two values. 
//The first value is the pin number, and the second value is either HIGH or LOW.

//Turn the LED on
digitalWrite(ledPin,HIGH);

//Leave it on for a short period of time
//Here we will use the delay() function.  It requires 1 input- a time, measured in milliseconds. 
//To delay for 1 second, we need to ener 1000 milliseconds. 

delay(1000);


 digitalWrite(ledPin,LOW);


 //Turn the buzzer on using the tone() function. We'll give it two inputs:  the pin, and a frequency. 


 delay(1000);

 //Turn off the redLED and the buzzer

 



}

//When the computer gets to the end of the loop, it will begin the process again.
